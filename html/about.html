              be stretching his skills and creativity. His goal is to solve compelling problems with innovation. His
              background in residential design has given him experience in handling challenges that don't necessarily
              have one concrete answer, but rather require creativity and resourcefulness to find new solutions that
              best fit the situation as well as the needs of a client. He believes these skills are applicable to any
              development or design medium, and would like to bring his skills into technology.
              When he isn't trapped under his cat, Vladimir, he enjoys collecting and playing board games, kayaking in
              Lake Union and Lake Washington, and eating at new restaurants. He is also a part of a trivia league, but
              don't expect him or his team to score very highly... its all about the fun!</p>
