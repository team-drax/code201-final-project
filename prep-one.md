## Conflict Plan

1. What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- We foster an open, receptive working environment where any issue is heard and discussed with a team-focused approach. As early as possible, we gather the team and talk it out together. The team will collectively determine a way forward.

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Have a "solve it at the lowest level" attitude. As early as possible, the group will have a transparent conversation about the roles and responsbilities of each member in the project and focus the conversation on group-centric outcomes.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Use our daily sync and "pair programming" opportunities this week to take responsbility and teach other where they may fall short and learn where we may fall short. Uses our group meetings to share our work and understanding of our individual projects so that everyone is up to speed. Again, we foster and promote questions so that we are always learning and have a transparent environment.

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Respectfully, with the goal of holding each other to transparent expectations. First, the group will discuss the "why?". Determine, as a group, a plan of approach to alleviate problems/concerns and provide support as needed.

5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

- A certain threshold must be hit. The threshold here invovles a willful action to not participate, hurt the project, or another member of the team. When that threshold is hit, we will involve Codefellows cadre.

## Communication Plan

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?
9AM - 6PM*. But also, whenever needed. Project week is only a week so if we have to sacrifice a bit of sleep during this week then so be it.
2. What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Slack, Remo, Phone.
3. How often will you take breaks? As needed. We're all adults.
4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Stay open to re-structuring or scaling back if the project proves to be too substantial for our timelines.
5. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? First, Slack. Emergencies, cell phone.
6. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? Dedicated time to speak during daily stand-up. Encouraging communication and conversation flow throughout the day and week via Slack and other communcation channels.
7. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? By asking questions when you need and genuinely answering others' questions.

## Work Plan

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- Two-fold. We intend to use Trello for our broad tasks and we intend to have a morning stand-up meeting for potentially more specific tasks/concerns. As the project evolves and more specific tasks are needed, we can identify them and assign them in Slack or morning stand-up meetings.

## Git Process

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?

- All of them. We will form an organization and create an "in Review" branch that will be the default. At least three members (ideally all) will link up for 10 minutes at the end of day and ask for any alibis before merges to the main occur.

3. What is your Git flow?

- During morning stand-up, confirm everyone has pulled from main.
- Ensure everyone is tracking their task/file that they will be working on.
- Create the daily branch using naming convention: [first name]-[file worked on]-[specific feature (if applicable)].
- frequent commits, one end-of-day push.
- End-of-day sync/push to main, and merge to main.
- Each member then git pulls from main to their system for tomorrow's work.

4. Will you be using a PR review workflow? Yes, we will have one person required to approve PR to "in Review" branch and two for "main" branch. We will come together each day to talk about our respective PRs and what we have accomplished for the day, and approve all PRs then.
