- The Creature of Pleiades is a choose your own adventure game/story mode that follows the user/protagonist through their finding a "creature" that they must care for and protect. The user chooses options and determines their own "path" and "ending". It is a fun, shared-experience game for the user to experience level-progression, interactive content, unique character development through a campaign-style story mode.

- The MVP should include at least three "different" outcomes based on user input/experience.
